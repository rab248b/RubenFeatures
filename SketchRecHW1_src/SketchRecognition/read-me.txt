In order to run the code, you need to run the runnable jar "SketchRecHW1.jar" from command line with the following command :
java -jar <SketchRecHW1_D.jar_location> <Data_Location>

For example:
java -jar C:\Users\Rahul\Desktop\SketchRec\SketchRecHW1_D.jar C:\Users\Rahul\workspace\SketchRecognition\data\Data\letters-json

The Data_Location can contain nested folders with data in the form of json files. 
The result file will be generated at <Data_Location> named "result.csv". 

The data generated by this code for both sample and letter shapes is stored in the result folder of the source code.
Also, weka reports are inside the result folder.

You can modify the source code to change the result file location. The data location is passed as an argument to main function just in case you need to modify the data location as well.
